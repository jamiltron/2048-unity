2048-unity
==========

A [2048 clone](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) written in [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) as a practice to see how well it could handle a basic puzzle game.


Instructions
------------

Use arrow keys or WASD to move.    
R to reset.  
    
Join matching tiles to advance powers of 2. Try to get to 2048!


TODO
----
Clean up and DRY the code.    
Use object pooling for the tiles just to.    
Maybe add slide animation.    
Maybe add score ticking animation.
