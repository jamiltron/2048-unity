2048-unity
==========

A [2048 clone](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) written in Unity as a practice to see how well Unity would handle it.


Instructions
------------

Use arrow keys or WASD to move. R to reset.  
Join matching tiles to advance powers of 2. Try to get to 2048!


TODO
----

Add fail state.      
Add "check-for-valid-move"
Maybe add slide animation.
Maybe add score ticking animation.
